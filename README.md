# CSCK541 CSCK541 Software Development in Practice October 2022 A: Group Project

## Project Description
Build a simple client/server network that can complete the following tasks:
1.  Create a dictionary and serialize it to Binary and JSON
2.  Send the serialized dictionary from client to server
3.  Create the encrypted text file and send it from client to server
4.  Server is able to deserialize and print the dictionary
5.  Server is able to decrypt the text file and print the content
6.  Perform unittest to validate the code's functionality

The code is written to PEP standard and uses exception handling to handle potential errors.

## Usage
1.  Clone the project into your IDE through https://github.com/SYEUNG114/client-server-network
2.  Execute `Server_Code.py` to start listening from the client
3.  Execute `Client_Code.py` to make connection from server
4.  Run unit test with `Unittest.py`
